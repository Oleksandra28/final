\chapter{Future Work}
\label{futureworkchapter}

In this chapter, we discuss the possible future directions for the approches used in the work. 

First, we would like to perform additional experiments using multi-source domain adaptation approach presented in Chapter \ref{mdachapter}. Precisely, the method introduced by \citet{mda} may require more parameter tuning. So far, tuning the parameter sigma has not resulted in the higher accuracy. Thus, there might be more factors to consider that may impact the performance of the classifier. 

Furthermore, since CORAL used together with Variance Threshold has resulted in the higher accuracy, we would like to further research this approach, and also run additional experiments on the data used in \citep{imran2016lrec}.

Finally, with the increasing usage of deep learning in many machine learning applications, as well as convolutional neural networks in classification of crisis-related data, e.g. by \citet{imran2016lrec}, among others, it might be beneficial to apply deep learning to our data as well.
