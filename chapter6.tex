\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{colcusionschapter}

In this chapter, we discuss the overall findings and make conclusions based on the results obtained in all of the experiments.


We re-state the questions raised in Section \ref{colcusionschapter} of Chapter \ref{introduction}, and answer each of them in turn:

\begin{itemize}
  \item is labeled source data sufficient to train a supervised learning model to make accurate predictions on target data?




  \item does single-source domain adaptation result in the higher accuracy?






  \item does multi-source domain adaptation result in the higher accuracy as compared to single-source domain adaptation?



  
\end{itemize}
